title Bully Election Protocol

participant "Device A\nUUID: 123" as A
participant "Device B\nUUID: 456" as B
participant "Device C\nUUID: 789" as C

note over A, C: Device C has highest UUID, Device A has lowest

== Network Setup ==
note right of A: Each device maintains an election list with\npairs of (deviceAddress, UUID)

== Election Start (Coordinator Loss Detected) ==
note over A: Device A detects coordinator loss\nand starts election
A -> A: addElectionListMember(deviceAddresses, UUIDs)
A -> A: startElectionTimer()

A -> B: ELECTION_REQUEST
A -> C: ELECTION_REQUEST

note right of B: B receives election from A,\ncompares UUIDs
B -> B: getDevicesToElect()
B -> C: ELECTION_REQUEST

note right of C: C receives election messages,\ncompares UUIDs
C -> C: getDevicesToElect() (empty - highest UUID)

C --> A: ELECTION_ACK
C --> B: ELECTION_ACK

note over A: A receives OK from higher UUID\nso stops its election timer
A -> A: stopElectionTimer()

note over B: B receives OK from higher UUID\nso stops its election timer
B -> B: stopElectionTimer()

== Timer Expiration ==
note over C: No higher UUID devices,\ntimer expires
C -> C: becomeCoordinator()
C -> A: CONFIGURATION
C -> B: CONFIGURATION

note over A, C: Device C becomes the coordinator

== Failure Recovery ==
note over C: If Device C fails
A -> A: startElectionTimer()
B -> B: startElectionTimer()

A -> B: ELECTION_REQUEST
B -> A: ELECTION_ACK

note over A: A stops timer due to\nB's higher UUID
A -> A: stopElectionTimer()

note over B: B's timer expires,\nno higher UUID devices responded
B -> B: becomeCoordinator()
B -> A: CONFIGURATION

note over A, B: Device B becomes the new coordinator
