#High Noon Blitz
The project aims to build a peer-to-peer Android game using the Bluetooth communication protocol. The objective is to implement a reaction-based game where the players have to react faster than each other to a specific random signal, miming a “high noon dual”.
Any node of the network (a phone) will be able to create or participate in a match. The game will consist of several rounds that end when one of the players finishes lifes. In the case there are more than two, the game will end when only one of them is left.
